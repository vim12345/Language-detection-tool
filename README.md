# Language-detection-tool
# Description:
A language detection tool automatically identifies the language of a given piece of text. This project uses a pretrained language identification model from langdetect (or langid), which supports dozens of languages and can be extended to route text to language-specific NLP pipelines.

# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Uses langdetect to identify language codes (e.g., 'en', 'fr', 'de')

* Detects language from short or long text inputs

* Provides confidence scores for language predictions
